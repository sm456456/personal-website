                    <h3>My curiosity turned me into a web developer.</h3>
                    <p>
                      I always thought my true calling is to travel the world. Spending a year 
                      in the USA as Au-pair terrified me at first, but I was too curious. My friendly 
                      host family made sure I’m experiencing every aspect of American culture and 
                      helped me to learned English.
                      After that, I applied for a job as a casino dealer on cruise ships. It seemed 
                      like a great idea; being paid while traveling the world. In reality, it was more 
                      challenging. Casino dealers (like web developers) have a steep learning curve. 
                      When dealing roulette, a dealer must multiply the number of winning chips with 
                      either 35, 17 or 8 and add all other side bets on top. All that in a few seconds. 
                      Also, one contract meant to work without a day off for 6 months! I loved the experience, 
                      but wanted a more technical job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In Ireland, I learned many internal software programs that I was using for work at 
                      Hertz. However, only after moving to Germany, I’ve got something more challenging: 
                      to learn German. For 4 months I worked full-time and simultaneously attended an intensive
                      German course every day for 3.5 hours. That’s why I’m very proud to hold a C1 certificate 
                      in German language. However, my fascination with computers and software didn’t stop. I 
                      started watching one online tutorial after another one. During the first lockdown I 
                      participated in EU vs Virus Hackathon. Seeing how developers can bring ideas to life amazed 
                      me. That was it, finally there was a job which is a combination of logic, problem-solving 
                      and creativity. And the best part; I can never learn everything! I joined WBS coding school 
                      full time program. Some days I wondered how one person can remember all that, and other days 
                      I felt like a genius.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Today, I enjoy bringing ideas to life in the form of web applications using JavaScript, 
                      React JS, Node JS, Express, Mongo DB, Mongoose, and other programming languages and 
                      frameworks. I’m very enthusiastic to deepen my knowledge and to learn more.
